Explanation:
Comments: Comments in HTML start with <!-- and end with -->. They are used to add notes or explanations in the code without affecting how the document is displayed. Comments are helpful for developers to understand the structure and purpose of the code.

Special Characters: Special characters in HTML need to be written using HTML entities to be displayed correctly. Some examples:

&lt; for <
&gt; for >
&amp; for &
&quot; for "
&copy; for the copyright symbol (©)
&euro; for the Euro symbol (€)
&trade; for the trademark symbol (™)
&reg; for the registered symbol (®)
&le; for less than or equal to (≤)
&ge; for greater than or equal to (≥) -->
